# phpdepend-processor

These snippets should help you to generate PHPDepend metrics for your PHP code.
The included task-definition for [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) will generate the metrics and process them to a human readable HTML document using XSLT.

The Ant-Task definition can be found in [src/ant/build.xml](src/ant/build.xml) and the used processors are in [src/xsl](src/xsl).

## Examples
In the [examples directory](examples/), you can find some demo content generated with this stuff.

## Version
