# phpdepend-processor

These snippets should help you to generate [PHPDepend](http://pdepend.org/) metrics for your PHP project.
The included task-definition for [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) will generate the metrics and process them to a human-readable HTML document using XSL transformations.

The definition of the ant task can be found in [src/ant/build.xml](src/ant/build.xml) and the used stylesheets are in [src/xsl](src/xsl).

## Examples
In the [examples directory](examples/), you can find some demo content generated with this stuff.
